Details: 
For ScaRestaff 2021, I dressed up our lovable RTP heroes in Halloween costumes. To help me decide which hero would wear what, I used a random number generator and it could not have chosen more perfect.
This release includes:
Reid as a fairy (both in costume and as an actual flying fairy - flower crowns included),
Kasey as a zombie (both in costume and as an actual zombie),
Gale as a warlock and witch,
Michelle as a devil (both in costume and as an actual devil),
Priscilla in a TwoFace/Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde costume,
Harold as a nurse.

The sprites are edited from the MZ RTP, with the exception of Harold, which is edited from the MV RTP.

Notes: 
To be able to use the Harold sprites in MV/MZ, please do not remove the $ from the file name.
I have done something similar in the past for the VX(Ace) heroes: https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/scarestaff-october-2015.45551/
